# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a global open source platform for decentralized applications. It can be imagined as a world computer that never stops.<br>
On Ethereum, software developers can write smart contracts, which control digital value through a set of standards. Decentralized applications (Dapps) that provide so-called DeFi financial services.<br>
Smart contracts written by software engineers are components of these Dapps. These smart contracts are deployed to the Ethereum network and run 24 hours a day in the network. The network continuously maintains the digital value ledger and tracks its latest status.

## What are smart contracts?

Smart contracts are programmable contracts that allow trading partners to set trading conditions and execute transactions without trusting a third party.

## What is Ether (ETH)?

Ether is the native digital currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether acts like currency and is similar to Bitcoin and can be used for daily transactions.<br>
Ether can be sent to another person to purchase goods and services based on current market prices. The Ethereum blockchain records these transactions and ensures that they are immutable.<br>

In addition, Ether is also used to pay for the operation of smart contracts and Dapps in the Ethereum network(Think of executing smart contracts on the Ethereum network as driving a car, fuel is needed).<br>
In order to execute smart contracts on Ethereum, you need to pay a fee called **Gas** in Ether.<br>
Currently, in the DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum is the preferred asset for many DeFi Dapps’ underlying collateral. It provides security and transparency for this financial system.

## What is Gas?

On Ethereum, all transactions and contract executions require a small fee. This fee is called Gas. Technically speaking, Gas refers to a unit of measurement of the computational resources required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the operation being executed, the more Gas is required to complete it. <u>Gas fees are paid entirely in ETH</u>.

- Gas Fee‘s Characteristics
  - The price of Gas fluctuates from time to time depending on the current network demand. Since computing resources on the network are limited, if more people interact on the Ethereum blockchain,<br>
    such as transferring ETH or executing smart contracts, then the price of Gas will increase. Conversely, if the network is not fully utilized, then the market price of Gas will decrease.<br>
  - Gas fees can be set manually. In the event of network congestion due to high utilization, transactions with the highest gas fees will be verified first.<br>
    Verified transactions will be finalized and added to the blockchain. If the gas fee is set too low, the transaction will enter the waiting queue and take some time to be packaged.<br>
    Therefore, transactions with lower-than-average gas fees take longer to complete.

## What is a decentralized application (Dapp)?

In the Ethereum network, Dapp is an interface that interacts with the blockchain through the use of smart contracts. From the front end, Dapp looks and operates similar to regular web applications and mobile applications, except that they interact with the blockchain in different ways.

### What are the advantages of Dapp?

- **Immutability:** Once information is saved on the blockchain, it cannot be changed by anyone;<br>
- **Tamper-proof:** Smart contracts published on the blockchain cannot be tampered with without the knowledge of other participants on the blockchain;<br>
- **Transparency:** Smart contract-driven Dapps are publicly auditable;<br>
- **Availability:** As long as the Ethereum network remains active, Dapps built on it will remain active and available.<br>

### What are the disadvantages of Dapp?

- **Immutability:** Smart contracts are written by humans, so human errors are inevitable, and immutable smart contracts may amplify errors.<br>
- **Transparency:** Publicly auditable smart contracts can also become a medium for hacker attacks, because hackers can find contract vulnerabilities by viewing the code;<br>
- **Scalability:** In most cases, the bandwidth of a Dapp is limited by the blockchain it resides on.<br>

## What else can Ethereum do?

In addition to creating Dapps, Ethereum has two other functions: creating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or issuing other cryptocurrencies.<br>
- DAO<br>
  It is a fully autonomous organization that is not managed by individuals, but rather by code. The code is run based on smart contracts,<br>
  allowing DAO to replace the typical operating model of traditional institutions. Since it runs on code, it will be free from human intervention and will operate transparently without any outside influence.<br>
  The management decisions or rulings of the DAO will be decided by voting with DAO tokens.

- Token<br>
  Ethereum can be used as a platform to create other cryptocurrencies. Currently, there are two popular token protocols on the Ethereum network:<br>
  - ERC-20:<br>
    ERC-20 tokens are fungible tokens, meaning that they are interchangeable and have the same value.<br>
  - ERC-721:<br>
    ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible tokens, meaning that the tokens are unique and non-interchangeable.<br>

  A simple analogy is to think of ERC-20 as currency and ERC-721 as collectibles like figurines or baseball cards.<br>

## Decentralized Stablecoins

The price of cryptocurrencies is very volatile. To mitigate this volatility, stablecoins whose prices are anchored to stable assets such as the US dollar were created.<br>
Stablecoins can help users hedge against cryptocurrency price fluctuations and serve as a reliable medium of exchange. Stablecoins have since quickly evolved into a powerful component of DeFi and become the key to this modular ecosystem.

### Main categories of stablecoins

Not all stablecoins are the same, as they use different mechanisms to peg to the US dollar. There are two types of pegs, fiat-collateralized and crypto-collateralized.<br>
Most stablecoins use a fiat-collateralized system to maintain their peg to the US dollar.

- Tether(USDT)
Tether is pegged to $1 by holding $1 in reserves for every Tether token minted. Although Tether is the largest and most widely used stablecoin, with an average daily trading volume of approximately $30 billion in January 2020,<br>
Tether's reserves are held in financial institutions, and users have to trust that Tether as an entity actually has the amount of reserves it claims. Therefore, Tether is a **centralized, fiat-collateralized stablecoin**.

- Dai
Dai (DAI), on the other hand, is collateralized by cryptocurrencies such as ETH. The value of Dai is pegged to $1 through a protocol and smart contracts voted on by a decentralized autonomous organization.<br>
At any given time, the collateral used to generate DAI can be easily verified by users. DAI is a **decentralized, cryptocurrency-collateralized stablecoin**.
