## Decentralized Stablecoins

The price of cryptocurrencies is very volatile. To mitigate this volatility, stablecoins whose prices are anchored to stable assets such as the US dollar were created.<br>
Stablecoins can help users hedge against cryptocurrency price fluctuations and serve as a reliable medium of exchange. Stablecoins have since quickly evolved into a powerful component of DeFi and become the key to this modular ecosystem.

### Main categories of stablecoins

Not all stablecoins are the same, as they use different mechanisms to peg to the US dollar. There are two types of pegs, fiat-collateralized and crypto-collateralized.<br>
Most stablecoins use a fiat-collateralized system to maintain their peg to the US dollar.

- Tether(USDT)
Tether is pegged to $1 by holding $1 in reserves for every Tether token minted. Although Tether is the largest and most widely used stablecoin, with an average daily trading volume of approximately $30 billion in January 2020,<br>
Tether's reserves are held in financial institutions, and users have to trust that Tether as an entity actually has the amount of reserves it claims. Therefore, Tether is a **centralized, fiat-collateralized stablecoin**.

- Dai
Dai (DAI), on the other hand, is collateralized by cryptocurrencies such as ETH. The value of Dai is pegged to $1 through a protocol and smart contracts voted on by a decentralized autonomous organization.<br>
At any given time, the collateral used to generate DAI can be easily verified by users. DAI is a **decentralized, cryptocurrency-collateralized stablecoin**.
