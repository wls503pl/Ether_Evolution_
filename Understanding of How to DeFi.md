## Not so lucky people
There are many less fortunate people(More than one billion) out there who don’t even have the most basic savings account. World Bank estimates:(https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex)
The main reasons they don’t have bank accounts include poverty, location and trust issues. Getting banking services is difficult — but DeFi has the potential to make it easy.

### <Decentralized Finance> vs (Traditional Finance)
Even big banks can fail, in the United States alone, there are more than 500 bank failures. Banks are one of the central nodes that lead to the collapse of the financial system.
It is very dangerous to concentrate power and money in the hands of banks.

Transparency is also closely related to this - ordinary investors cannot fully understand the operations of financial institutions.
DeFi is different in this regard. DeFi protocols built on public blockchains (such as Ethereum) are mostly open source, which facilitates auditing and improves transparency.

### Characteristics of DeFi
The DeFi protocol will be written as lines of code that treat every participant equally and without discrimination, and the code will run exactly as it is written.
The code will be open source for public review, and any vulnerabilities will quickly become apparent.
Ultimately, the biggest advantage of DeFi is the ability to eliminate intermediaries and operate in a zero-censorship environment.
