## Not so lucky people
There are many less fortunate people(More than one billion) out there who don’t even have the most basic savings account.<br>
World Bank estimates: [Global Findex, World Bank, 2021](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex)<br>
The main reasons they don’t have bank accounts include poverty, location and trust issues. Getting banking services is difficult — but DeFi has the potential to make it easy.

### (Decentralized Finance) vs (Traditional Finance)
Even big banks can fail, in the United States alone, there are more than 500 bank failures. Banks are one of the central nodes that lead to the collapse of the financial system.
It is very dangerous to concentrate power and money in the hands of banks.

Transparency is also closely related to this - ordinary investors cannot fully understand the operations of financial institutions.
DeFi is different in this regard. DeFi protocols built on public blockchains (such as Ethereum) are mostly open source, which facilitates auditing and improves transparency.

### What is DeFi?
Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a movement that enables users to use financial services such as lending and trading without relying on centralized entities.<br>
These financial services are provided by decentralized applications (Dapps), most of which are deployed on the Ethereum platform.

DeFi is not a single product or company, but a series of products and services that replace institutions such as banks, insurance, bonds, and money markets. DeFi Dapp allows users to combine the services they provide, thereby opening up more possibilities.

### Characteristics of DeFi
The DeFi protocol will be written as lines of code that treat every participant equally and without discrimination, and the code will run exactly as it is written.<br>
The code will be open source for public review, and any vulnerabilities will quickly become apparent.<br>
Ultimately, the biggest advantage of DeFi is the ability to eliminate intermediaries and operate in a zero-censorship environment.

### How to use DeFi?
In order to use DeFi Dapps, users usually need to lock collateral in smart contracts(The cumulative value of collateral locked in DeFi Dapps is often referred to as the total value locked).

### Main Categories of DeFi
- Stablecoins

The price of cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile. Intraday price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies often exceed 10%. In order to mitigate this volatility, stablecoins anchored to stable assets such as the US dollar have been created (Tether (USDT) is one of the earliest centralized stablecoins introduced. It is said that each USDT is backed by one US dollar in the bank account of its issuing institution).

- Borrowing

The traditional financial system requires users to have a bank account to use their services, but more than a billion people do not have a bank account. There are other restrictions on getting a loan from a bank,
such as the requirement to have a good credit score and the need to have enough collateral to convince the bank that the applicant is creditworthy and able to repay the loan.
Decentralized lending removes this barrier by allowing anyone to pledge their digital assets and then use the pledged assets to obtain a loan. At the same time, users can also earn income from their assets and participate in the loan market by injecting assets into the lending pool to earn interest. With decentralized lending, borrowers no longer need a bank account or credit checks.

- Exchanges
  - Centralized Exchanges
    
    Users can use exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance to exchange cryptocurrencies. These exchanges are centralized, meaning they are both intermediaries and custodians of trading assets.<br>
    Users of these exchanges do not have full control over their assets, and if the exchange is hacked and cannot repay its debts, users will face huge losses.

  - Decentralized Exchanges
    
    Decentralized exchanges aim to solve the above problems by allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies without giving up custody of their assets.<br>
    Since there is no need to deposit assets like in centralized exchanges, users do not need to trust that the exchange actually remains solvent.

- Derivatives
  
A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from another underlying asset such as a stock, commodity, currency, index, bond or interest rate. Traders can use derivatives to hedge their positions, thereby reducing their risk on a particular trade.<br>
Let's say you are a glove manufacturer and you want to hedge against an unexpected rise in rubber prices. You can buy a futures contract from your supplier to deliver a certain amount of rubber at a specific delivery date in the future at a currently agreed price,e.g.

- Fund Management
  
Fund management is the process of overseeing your assets and managing their cash flows to generate investment returns. There are two main types of fund management: active and passive. Active fund management has a management team responsible for investment decisions in order to outperform a specific benchmark such as the S&P 500. Passive fund management has no management team and is designed to perform as closely as possible to a specific benchmark.
In DeFi, some projects have begun to allow passive fund management in a decentralized manner. The transparency of DeFi makes it easy for users to track how their funds are managed and know the fees they will pay.

- Lottery
  
As DeFi continues to evolve, creative and disruptive financial applications will emerge that democratize access to financial services and remove intermediaries. Lottery with DeFi can transfer the custody of the fund pool to Ethereum smart contracts

- Payment
  
A key role of cryptocurrency is to allow decentralized and trustless transfers between two parties. With the development of DeFi, more and more innovative payment methods are being created and tested.

- Insurance
  
All tokens locked in smart contracts are vulnerable to smart contract vulnerabilities because they can lead to large amounts of funds being transferred out. Although most projects have audited codebases, we can never know if the smart contract is truly secure, and the possibility of losses from hacker attacks always exists. These risks highlight the need to purchase insurance, especially when users are handling large amounts of funds on DeFi.
