A Dutch auction is a type of auction where the price starts high and then gradually decreases until a buyer is willing to accept the current price.<br>
Here are some key points about a Dutch auction:<br>
1. Auction process<br>
- The auctioneer sets a high starting price.<br>
- The price is gradually reduced at predetermined intervals until a buyer is willing to accept the current price.<br>
- The first buyer to indicate a willingness to buy wins the auction and purchases the item at that price.

2. Application Scenario<br>
- Dutch auctions are often used for auctions of perishable goods (such as flowers and fish) or for auctions that need to be completed quickly.<br>
- This auction format is also used in some financial products and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

3. Advantage<br>
- Fast: Auctions are usually completed in a short time because prices are constantly falling.<br>
- Price discovery: Buyers can decide when to bid based on their valuation and needs.

4. Differences from traditional auctions<br>
- Traditional auctions (such as English auctions) usually start with a low price and gradually increase the price until there are no higher bids.<br>

Dutch auctions provide an efficient price discovery mechanism, particularly suitable for market environments that require rapid decision-making.
